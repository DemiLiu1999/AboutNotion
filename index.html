        Notion supports very rich expressive capabilities, not only for text, images, audio and video, and attachments, but also for users to insert entire data tables into them, as well as inline content with platforms such as Figma, Github, and YouTube. This content can be reorganized on Notion's flexible pages in the form of "blocks", which Notion calls "Blocks". This is Notion's main commercialization model.
