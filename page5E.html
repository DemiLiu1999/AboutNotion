            Mentions and reminders are a quick and easy way to link to other pages in your workspace, bring specific content to the attention of the colleagues, and set up timely reminders for yourself and others. To bring up all these options, just go to any Notion page and type the “@” symbol. That opens the mention menu with three choices. You can mention a date, a person, or a page.

        <p class="normal">
            For example, these are records from a team meeting. Type in “@” here. And start typing the title of the page you want to mention. Once it shows up, you can select the title, and it’s done. The page is now hyperlinked here.

        <p class="normal">
            If this action is assigned to someone in particular, you can mention them here so they’ll know it’s for them. Type in “@” and start typing your colleagues name, until it shows up. Select the name and it’s done.

            You can also mention colleagues in comments within a page.

            This can also add a time stamp on a page. For instance, once you update this page, you can document the date like this. You can even write words like today, tomorrow, or yesterday, and they will turn into their corresponding dates as time passes.

            Here are the steps for setting up reminders. For instance, set a reminder for Peter’s birthday in your agenda. I will type “@” and the word “remind” followed by the day in time I would like to get the reminder.

            If you want more granular reminder options, you can enable include time.
